Pre-compute as much as you can,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"Many parts of our web site are read heavy, so in a lot of places it makes sense to pre-compute instead of reacting to a request. Examples would be change propagation for listings, static content and CQRS"
Two-Factor auth. for everyone where possible,adopt,techniques,FALSE,As we are using public cloud services and managed services reachable from the Internet we consider a second factor during authentication as a must-have.
Shadow Traffic,adopt,techniques,FALSE,Testing new services with natural traffic has proven to be a reliable method. Replicating traffic to the shadowed system is easy to implement.
Game Day Exercises,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"We want to avoid the 'backup without recovery' or the 'untested disaster readiness plan'. We should excercise our disaster recovery strategy regularly and have game days with different kinds of disasters. <a href=""http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2016/3/3/the-new-normal-minimize-risk-by-maximizing-change"">THE NEW NORMAL: Minimize risk by maximizing change</a>"
Feature Toggles 'the proper way',adopt,techniques,FALSE,"There couldn't be a better explanation: <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html"">Pete Hodgson on Martin Fowler's Bliki - Feature Toggles</a>. Read it. Do it."
Q.A. in Production,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"With the rise of Continuous Delivery, the QA role is shifting to include analyzing software product quality in production. This involves monitoring of the production systems, coming up with alert conditions to detect urgent errors, determining ongoing quality issues and figuring out what measurements you can use in the production environment to make this work. This does not mean that pre-production QA is not needed anymore."
Custom Elements,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/"">Custom Elements</a> is a capability for creating your own custom HTML elements. They can have their own scripted behavior and CSS styling. They are a part of web components, but can also be used by themselves."
External User Journey Monitoring,trial,techniques,FALSE,"In addition to monitoring individual services, we need to make sure that typical journeys of our users on AutoScout24 are working and performant from the outside. For example the search funnel journey from home page to creating a lead or the journey to create a listing."
CI Pipeline as Code,trial,techniques,FALSE,"We strive to keep logic out of the build pipeline and every deployment should be runnable from the developer's machine. But still there are manual steps required and changes in the pipeline are not tracked together with the source repository. Therefore we think it is a good option to put the pipeline configuration under version control, too."
Docker as artifact,trial,techniques,FALSE,"Docker is offering many advantages like immutability, independence and portability. We want to profit from those, but without the burden of maintaining Docker clusters in the first hand. Therefore we currently see the Docker container mostly as a build artifact"
Consumer-Driven Contracts,trial,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html"">Consumer-Driven Contracts</a> are a pattern for evolving services. Each consumer provides a contract to the service provider. The service provider can use these contracts to check if a planned change will break a client."
Progressive Webapps,trial,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/"">Progressive web apps</a> are web apps that are aiming to provide a similar experience as native apps. Depending on the device and browser our web app should progressively enhance the experience for the user."
Canary Releases,trial,techniques,FALSE,"The name for this technique originates from miners who would carry a canary in a cage down the coal mines. If toxic gases leaked into the mine, it would kill the canary before killing the miners. A canary release provides a similar form of early warning for potential problems before impacting your entire production infrastructure or user base. Compared to `Feature Toggles` or `BlueGreen Deployments` this is not a simple switch but more a slider. FeatureBee (Scala) as well as AutoCanary24 support Canary Releases. You can canary release toggled features with traffic distribution or you can canary deploy new service instances with traffic distribution or shadow traffic."
Docker for Build Agents,trial,techniques,FALSE,"Sharing build servers with other pipelines is efficient but creates a dependency to the underlying software packages. We are all dependent on the Java, Ruby etc. installations on the agents. This can lead to time-consuming coordination and broken builds. Building software in Docker containers helps to get independent of the build agent and to avoid interferences between pipelines of different services."
CQRS/Event Sourcing,trial,techniques,FALSE,"Command Query Responsibility Segregatin and Event Sourcing are a very powerful pattern, but no silver bullet. Immutable events stored in an append only fashion together with a read optimized query part make a good fit for microservices and for many use cases at AutoScout24. A good introduction: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/microservices-event-sourcing-cqrs"">Building Microservices with Event Sourcing and CQRS</a>. A good explanation that puts some concepts into context: <a href=""https://www.confluent.io/blog/making-sense-of-stream-processing/"">Stream processing, Event sourcing, Reactive, CEP... and making sense of it all</a>."
Pull Request by Default,trial,techniques,TRUE,
Business KPI Monitoring,trial,techniques,FALSE,"In addition to a ""keep the lights on"" monitoring, we need to include a business minded approach to monitoring. Include relevant business KPIs on dashboards and alert on anomonlies in those metrics. Is everything green for our customers and our business?  "
IPv6,trial,techniques,TRUE,The availability of IPv6 in several AWS services makes it easy to consider using it in internal communication as well as providing IPv6 enabled endpoints to our users. We are therefore evaluating the impact on our web site performance.
Virtual Reality,trial,techniques,TRUE,
Artificial Intelligence,trial,techniques,TRUE,
Serverless Techniques,trial,techniques,TRUE,We are evaluating using AWS Lambda for certain use cases. With the announcement of AWS Step Functions and the Serverless Application Model AWS provides us with even better support for serverless web applications.
Reproducible Build Artifacts from code,trial,techniques,TRUE,"For us one of the most important aspects of continous integration is the reproducability of build artifacts. Because of this we try hard to reduce external dependencies in our pipelines to guarantee, that the output of building a certain code revision leads to the exact same artifacts."
Decouple Build and Deploy Tool,assess,techniques,FALSE,"We are currently using GoCD for CI and CD. This is convenient, as we have one place to define and see the whole pipeline. On the other hand are we limiting us to an agent based delivery. We could use one tools for CI that creates verified artifacts and use another specialized tool for delivery. This differentiation makes even more sense, when we look into container scheduler. For example Netflix uses Jenkins for CI and Spinnaker for delivery: <a href=""http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/03/how-we-build-code-at-netflix.html"">How we build code at Netflix<a/>"
Content Security Policy,assess,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://content-security-policy.com/"">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a>  is a new HTTP response header, allowing to reduce XSS risks on modern browsers by declaring what dynamic resources are allowed to load via a HTTP Header."
Automated Architecture Diagram,assess,techniques,FALSE,Documenting systems is hard. Manually created architecture diagrams are short-lived and seldomly updated. To increase the quality and currentness of our documentation we are looking into ways to automatically depict architecture diagrams.
Data Pump 'diversity',hold,techniques,FALSE,"Our data pumps are an implementation of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture"">Change data capture (CDC)</a> pattern. All our data pumps read from the same Oracle database and pump to AWS, but we ended up with many different implementations."
CMS Boxes misuse,hold,techniques,FALSE,"CMS boxes are a common pattern for us. They provided a fast way to get different content on the web pages. As we are deploying more often today and have introduced UI composition to include content from different sources, we think that we should use CMS boxes for editorial content only. We should not use them for bringing advertisements or label texts on the pages."
Feature Branches,hold,techniques,FALSE,Feature branches isolate your work and defer continuous integration. The longer they exist the more it hurts to merge them back. Practices like Gitflow can support such a behaviour. When the only reason to start a new branch is the fear of continuous integration and therefore continuous deployment stop it.
Custom Basic Authentication,hold,techniques,FALSE,"While we are in our migration phase from the datacenter to the cloud not all platform services are available yet. To secure our APIs and administrative pages is hard without being able to use an identity service, therefore we have started to create workarounds by seting up custom basic authentication. We should strive to replace those solutions with proper OAuth2 implementations."
Akka Circuit Breaker,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/circuitbreaker.html"">Akka circuit breaker</a> is an alternative for the more famous Hystrix, that fits god into our stack."
Security Monkey,adopt,tools,FALSE,We are using Security Monkey for auditing our security relevant resources in AWS. It has proven to be a reliable and helpful tool and led to improved overall security.
Kafka,adopt,tools,FALSE,We chose Kafka for our internal data enrichment pipelines. The lack of the log compaction feature in AWS Kinesis led us to roll our own solution.
Chaos Monkey,adopt,tools,FALSE,Testing our systems for resiliency is important to us. Chaos Monkey randomly kills machines in our live environment and helps us finding and preventing shortcomings in our service setup.
git-secrets,adopt,tools,FALSE,"To prevent secrets leaking on GitHub we are scanning our repositories with git-secrets. Compared to gitrob this tool also scans the file contents and can work preemptively as a pre-commit hook. <a href=""https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets"">Git-secrets<a/>"
Travis CI,adopt,tools,FALSE,"TravisCI is one of these tools which supports configuration as code. It's widely adopted, especially in OSS. It can be used as SaaS or On-Prem. We use it for Open Source projects primarilly"
CloudHealth,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.cloudhealthtech.com/solutions/enterprise"">CloudHealth<a/> gives us insights into our AWS assets and costs."
WebPageTest.org,adopt,tools,FALSE,WebPageTest is used by our teams to evaluate the page performance in our pipelines.
CrossBrowserTesting.Com,trial,tools,FALSE,
OAuth2 for inter-service communication,trial,tools,FALSE,"Securing APIs with OAuth2 is a common pattern in the industry, we should use it also for our services when they are communicating with each other over public networks."
ElasticSearch Percolator,trial,tools,FALSE,"Inverted search: For us this would help with saved search, where we store the searches in ES and use our listing events to match saved searches and notify the users on matches. Either in realtime or when the user wants to be notified. <a href=""https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-percolate-query.html"">Perculate Query (Perculator successor)</a>"
ECS Aided Deployment,trial,tools,TRUE,Using AWS EC2 Container service to deploy docker containers as artifacts to machines reduces the burden of orchestrating the deployment steps. We try to use this also for the one container per host setup.
Gulp,trial,tools,FALSE,
Jenkins 2.0,trial,tools,FALSE,"After the release of Jenkins 2.0 and the native support for pipelines written in a Jenkinsfile we started to evaluate how it can help us solve many other issues we ran into with GoCD. To mention some: SAML authentication, building on dynamic agents on an ECS cluster, branch and pull request building and some more."
Instana,assess,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""http://www.instana.com/"">Instana</a> is a new generation monitoring service which is currently in beta status. It's high resolution and intelligent learning technology it looks like an interesting alternative to existing solutions."
Spinnaker,assess,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""http://www.spinnaker.io/"">Spinnaker</a> is a Netflix OSS cloud deployment tool. It feels quite heavy, but seems to gain a lot of traction. We could couple a future Spinnaker trial with a Travis CI trail and completely get rid of GoCD. This would then also include the Techniques 'Decouple Build and Deploy Tool'"
ElasticSearch Watcher,assess,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/watcher/current/index.html"">ElasticSearch Watcher</a> is an ElasticSearch plugin to create notifications based on the ES cluster data when some conditions occur. It can be used for further refining our alarming system or other types of notifications."
Cassandra,assess,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""http://cassandra.apache.org/"">Cassandra</a> is a highly available distributed database, with cross region replication. De facto standard for many cloud stacks, that would violate our AWS first priniciple. Only consider it, when we hit DynamoDB limitations."
Sauce Labs,assess,tools,TRUE,
Codacy,assess,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://www.codacy.com/"">Codacy</a> is a code review and code quality monitoring tool."
Team City,assess,tools,TRUE,We used Team City successfully in our data centers. Is it a potential successor for GoCD on AWS also?
Atomist,assess,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://www.atomist.com/"">Atomist</a> is a very young project geared towards developer productivity. Centered around ChatOps within Slack or CLI it aims to automate the whole development flow. Including smart, templated based repository creation and delivery pipelines."
Cloud Custodian,assess,tools,TRUE,"Capital One released <a href=""https://developer.capitalone.com/opensource-projects/cloud-custodian"">Cloud Custodian</a> to the OSS world. It's a rule engine caring about most of the known housekeeping tasks in larger AWS setups."
Data Dog APM,assess,tools,TRUE,Datadog released a private beta version of its new APM tool. We feel the need for deeper insights into our applications and request flows. As it does not support the JVM yet we keep an eye on its future development.
Hosted IDE,assess,tools,TRUE,Providing hosted IDEs to our engineers might reduce the effort of the initial setup of clients and could be a solution to remote pairing. 
X-Pack Graph,assess,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/xpack-graph.html"">X-Pack Graph for ElasticSearch<a/> Graphing connections in your data."
SVN,hold,tools,FALSE,"Even while subversion is a straight-foward version control system, it lacks in features like offline-support, pull requests and easy ways to merge and branch. Also the social coding features of GitHub.com speak for themselves."
Selenium Cluster,hold,tools,FALSE,
Oracle Materialized Views,hold,tools,FALSE,
Go CD,hold,tools,FALSE,"Even while GoCD is featured on the ThoughtWorks radar we still see a lot of effort in adding new pipelines. Also missing OAuth support, the missing support of configuration as code and fact that it doesn't scale dynamically are reasons to look for a tool that could handle these issues better."
HTTP/2,trial,platforms,TRUE,"<a href=""https://http2.github.io/"">HTTP/2</a> is the next revision of HTTP. Improves user perceived latency. Current estimations say that 50% of our users could connect via HTTP/2."
Elastic.io,assess,platforms,TRUE,"Facing issues with the AWS managed ElasticSearch service and to reduce the operational effort on our teams, we decided to evaluate other options of hosted ElasticSearch services."
Ruby for automation and scripting,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,At AutoScout24 ruby is the common language for automating our deployments. It's well-known in the company and is fairly easy to use even for beginners. We have already built some tooling for deployment in Ruby like autostacker24 and autocanary24.
Codahale Metrics,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://metrics.dropwizard.io/"">Dropwizard Metrics</a> (aka Codahale Metrics) allows to easily create custom application-level metrics and export them with JMX to DataDog"
Akka,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.lightbend.com/community/core-projects/akka"">Akka</a> is an actor based runtime for reactive applications in the Scala/JVM world. We use Play for the read side of AS24 and Akka could be good fit for the write side. See Lagom, which includes Akka."
EcmaScript 6,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/"">EcmaScript 6</a>"
ScalaTest,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://www.scalatest.org/"">ScalaTest</a> is the most popular testing tool in the Scala ecosystem. It is quite flexible and integrates well with IntelliJ IDEA."
WebDriver,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/"">WebDriver</a> is a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents. We use it for browser-based tests as driver for Selenium."
Pact CDC,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Define a <a href=""https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact"">pact</a> between service consumers and providers, enabling 'consumer driven contract' testing."
Apache Spark,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"A micro-batch data processing cluster with Scala API. Famous for being faster than Hadoop and for stream processing. Potential use cases, would be in the data platform, in the log event processing and in the listing enrichment pipeline."
Akka Persistence,trial,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href=""http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/persistence.html"">Akka Persistence</a> enables stateful Akka actors, that are backed by an event sourced journal storage. Different storage plugins are available."

"RxJava, RxScala",trial,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href=""https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava"">RxJava</a> and the RxScala adaptor brings the <a href=""http://reactivex.io/"">Reactive Extensions</a> to the JVM. This ""API for asynchronous programming with observable streams"" is for example a viable alternative to Akka streams when processing listings in our Kafka pipeline."
Protobuf / MessagePack,assess,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Fast and size optimized binary serialization format, created by Google. Has an out of band schema definition. This could be an alternative to Json in some usecases. See also Avro and MessagePack."
Apache Avro,assess,languages & frameworks,FALSE,Fast and size optimized binary rpc and serialization framework. Schema info is part of handshake. This could be an alternative to Json in some usecases. Favored by makers of Kafka. See also Protobuf and MsgPack.
GO Lang for Microservices,assess,languages & frameworks,FALSE,In the world of containers and microservices more and more companies are using Go to build their services. It's leightweight footprint and the absence of JIT-compilation make it an ideal candidate for use in a container. On the other hand it might lack some features and tools needed for web development. We should keep an eye on the development in the community.
Lagom,assess,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Reactive, eventsourced and CQRS based microservices on the Lightbend stack. Could be an extension of our Lightbend Play stack for microservices that are writing. See also Akka and Akka Persistence, which is part of <a href=""https://www.lightbend.com/lagom"">Lagom</a>"
