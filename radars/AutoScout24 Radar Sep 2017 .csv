Pre-compute as much as you can,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"Many parts of our web site are read heavy, so in a lot of places it makes sense to pre-compute instead of reacting to a request. Examples would be change propagation for listings, static content and CQRS"
Game Day Exercises,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"We want to avoid the 'backup without recovery' or the 'untested disaster readiness plan'. We should excercise our disaster recovery strategy regularly and have game days with different kinds of disasters. It is expected that Game Day Excercises lead to many challanges and exposes missing automation and concepts.<a href=""http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2016/3/3/the-new-normal-minimize-risk-by-maximizing-change"">THE NEW NORMAL: Minimize risk by maximizing change</a>"
Feature Toggles 'the proper way',adopt,techniques,FALSE,"There couldn't be a better explanation: <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html"">Pete Hodgson on Martin Fowler's Bliki - Feature Toggles</a>. As we put more and more services into production in new teams, we need emphasize the proper way: The first task in every new story should be to create the release toggle and you are only done, when the toggle is removed."
Custom Elements,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/"">Custom Elements</a> is a capability for creating your own custom HTML elements. They can have their own scripted behavior and CSS styling. They are a part of web components, but can also be used by themselves."
External User Journey Monitoring,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"In addition to monitoring individual services, we need to make sure that typical journeys of our users on AutoScout24 are working and performant from the outside. For example the search funnel journey from home page to creating a lead or the journey to create a listing."
Circuit Breaker,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html>Circuit breaker</a> is a stability pattern for distributed systems. We tried <a href=""https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix"">Hystrix</a> and <a href=""http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/circuitbreaker.html"">Akka Circuit Breaker</a>. Hystrix came out as our default circuit breaker tool."
Platform engineering product Teams,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"With introduction of AWS, we reduced the dependency to our former operations teams. But this approach also constrained some teams who lack the skills to self-manage a full application and operations stack.  We tackled this challenge by creating platform engineering product teams. These teams operate an internal platform which enables delivery teams to self-service deploy and operate systems with reduced lead time and stack complexity. The emphasis here is on API-driven self-service and supporting tools, with delivery teams still responsible for supporting what they deploy onto the platform. We do not want to create a separate DevOps team, and we are aware that some tools will be replaced whenever AWS (or others) offers a valuable solution."
Logging using STDOUT,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"All running processes log to STDOUT and we use logshipping to export data. As this is industry standard (<a href=""https://12factor.net/"">twelve factor app</a>) we also switch to this approach. This also helps with our adoption of Docker on ECS."
Performance Monitoring,adopt,techniques,FALSE,Continuously monitoring and showing the most important client side performance metrics on team dashboards. The goal is that degradation in client side performance is treated in the same way as red builds or bugs in production.
Business KPI Monitoring,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"In addition to a ""keep the lights on"" monitoring, we need to include a business minded approach to monitoring. Include relevant business KPIs on dashboards and alert on anomonlies in those metrics. Is everything green for our customers and our business?  "
Architecture Decision Records,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<a href=""https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools"">Architecture Decision Records</a> are a lightweight approach to document important architecural decisions. The records of those decisions live in the same repository as the service itself."
Consumer-Driven Contracts,trial,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html"">Consumer-Driven Contracts</a> are a pattern for evolving services. Each consumer provides a contract to the service provider. The service provider can use these contracts to check if a planned change will break a client."
Progressive Webapps,trial,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/"">Progressive web apps</a> are web apps that are aiming to provide a similar experience as native apps. Depending on the device and browser our web app should progressively enhance the experience for the user."
Canary Releases,trial,techniques,FALSE,"The name for this technique originates from miners who would carry a canary in a cage down the coal mines. If toxic gases leaked into the mine, it would kill the canary before killing the miners. A canary release provides a similar form of early warning for potential problems before impacting your entire production infrastructure or user base. Compared to `Feature Toggles` or `BlueGreen Deployments` this is not a simple switch but more a slider. Toguru as well as AutoCanary24 support Canary Releases. You can canary release toggled features with traffic distribution or you can canary deploy new service instances with traffic distribution or shadow traffic. <a href=""https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/03/how-release-canaries-can-save-your-bacon-CRE-life-lessons.html"">Google blog post on canaries</a>"
CQRS/Event Sourcing,trial,techniques,FALSE,"Command Query Responsibility Segregatin and Event Sourcing are a very powerful pattern, but no silver bullet. Immutable events stored in an append only fashion together with a read optimized query part make a good fit for microservices and for many use cases at AutoScout24. A good introduction: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/microservices-event-sourcing-cqrs"">Building Microservices with Event Sourcing and CQRS</a>. A good explanation that puts some concepts into context: <a href=""https://www.confluent.io/blog/making-sense-of-stream-processing/"">Stream processing, Event sourcing, Reactive, CEP... and making sense of it all</a>."
Content Security Policy,trial,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://content-security-policy.com/"">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a>  is a new HTTP response header, allowing to reduce XSS risks on modern browsers by declaring what dynamic resources are allowed to load via a HTTP Header."
Data-Driven Decisions,trial,techniques,TRUE,"Although we are experimenting and collecting data, we understand that we need to get better at enabling experimentation across services and improve our skills at hypothesis-driven development."
Automation with bots,trial,techniques,TRUE,A lot of processes and repeatable work is currently handled by humans. Using bots and processes defined in code work load and wait time is reduced and the quality of the task's results will improve
Container/ image security scanning,trial,techniques,TRUE,Increasing the utilization of Docker containers in our platform is our goal. With containers and microservices the number of deployed units rises tremendously. To ensure security in this environment we need to leverage automated ways of scanning for vulnerability in the Docker images as well as in the running containers.
Replicate DBTables to Kafka,assess,techniques,FALSE,"Use Oracles Undo Redo Log to do Logshipping to Kafka. First tool we try is <a href=""http://www.dbvisit.com/products/dbvisit_replicate_real_time_oracle_database_replication/"">DBVisit Replicate</a>"
Automated Architecture Diagram,assess,techniques,FALSE,"Documenting systems is hard. Manually created architecture diagrams are short-lived and seldomly updated. To increase the quality and currentness of our documentation we are looking into ways to automatically depict architecture diagrams. <a href=""http://gcdt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/20_kumo.html"">kumo</a> from the glomex-cloud-deployment-tools (gcdt) is an exmaple of a CloudFormation template visualization. We will also try AWS X-Ray to generate a service graph."
Functional Programming Adoption,assess,techniques,TRUE,"FP techniques such as functional composition, monadic transformations, currying and partial application can be used to handle data transformations and side-effects in a cleaner way on everyday code. Use of libraries such as <a href=""https://typelevel.org/cats/"" target=""_blank"">Cats</a> is highly recommended and encouraged to make functional programming accessible and easy to use and reap the full benefits of the Scala language, which is uniquely suited to bridge the OOP and functional worlds, instead of being simply ""a better Java""."
External Product Engineering,hold,techniques,FALSE,"When our internal product engineering appears to be too busy, it might be tempting to outsource urgent or important projects. In reality, many of those quickly delivered external projects are pulled into our product engineering. As unplanned work in different tech stacks, this slows engineering down."
Log everything,hold,techniques,FALSE,"Logging just everything that could be possibly be logged is wasteful, expensive and rarely useful. For example logging each and every request in Jigsaw and all ELBs on the way  is causing issues with the logging infrastructure regularly. It makes operation painful, events are lost and queries are really slow. If you just need metrics like latencies, response status codes then use metrics (CloudWatch or Dropwizard) and not logging."
IP-Restriction,hold,techniques,FALSE,"We often see IP restriction as a mechnism to prevent unauthorized access. But it sounds like a good idea only in the first place, as there is no real authentication and authorization. It also introduces a wrong dependency between our local office IT and production services in the cloud. Instead, a proper protocol (like OAuth) in combination with Auth0 should be used. Nevertheless for systems without immediate production impact, it can be a valid option as an additional security layer."
Data Pump 'diversity',hold,techniques,FALSE,"Our data pumps are an implementation of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture"">Change data capture (CDC)</a> pattern. All our data pumps read from the same Oracle database and pump to AWS, but we ended up with many different implementations. Data pumps are part of some of our longer running migration strategies, but for smaller contexts they might not be needed at all. "
Feature Branches,hold,techniques,FALSE,"Feature branches isolate your work and defer continuous integration. The longer they exist the more it hurts to merge them back. Practices like Gitflow can support such a behaviour. When the only reason to start a new branch is the fear of continuous integration and therefore continuous deployment stop it. Short-lived branches are ok, when they are merged within a day. <a href=""https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/"">https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/</a>"
Custom Basic Authentication,hold,techniques,FALSE,"While we are in our migration phase from the datacenter to the cloud not all platform services are available yet. To secure our APIs and administrative pages is hard without being able to use an identity service, therefore we have started to create workarounds by seting up custom basic authentication. We should strive to replace those solutions with proper OAuth2 implementations."
Dependencies to the data center,hold,techniques,TRUE,"While we are migrating to AWS we have to care a lot about integrating existing services with new ones in the Cloud. On the other hand we need to be careful to not build unwanted dependencies between those. Our new services on AWS should not fail due to issues in the datacentre. Therefore we need to avoid synchronous communication, for example we should avoid calling endpoints in the datacentre from services in AWS synchronously as backend services."
Microstrategy,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.microstrategy.com"">Microstrategy</a> is a Business Intelligence and Analytics software. We use it as our central tool to analyse our data and to create dashboards."
Docker Compose for local dev stacks,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://docs.docker.com/compose/"">Docker compose</a> allows for ""one-click"" local app environment setups, which are essential for fast developer productivity, especially for complex projects that depend on multiple services to run (i.e Kafka/Elasticsearch related services). All autoscout24 projects should be launchable just by calling `docker-compose up` without any other system dependencies."
Open API,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.openapis.org/"">Open API</a> is a popular API description format for REST-like APIs. We choose it as main tool to describe our service. There is a rich set of tools available that can use an Open API description for generating documentation, mock a server or doing CDCs. It's also possible to generate server and client code, but the usage of this feature is controversial."
OAuth2 for inter-service communication,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Securing APIs with OAuth2 is a common pattern in the industry, we should use it also for our services when they are communicating with each other over public networks."
Datadog Automatization,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.datadoghq.com/"">Datadog</a> is our central monitoring solution. We are evaluating code to bring datadog alarms and dashbaord to code. We would like to follow our ""automate everything"" principal. TODO [JM/IA]: Adjust text, to explain solution. Adjust service template to include a DataDog custom resource example."
Fastlane,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://fastlane.tools/"">fastlane</a> is the tool to release your iOS and Android app It handles all tedious tasks, like generating screenshots, dealing with code signing, and releasing your apps"
Docker-based Selenium Grid,adopt,tools,FALSE,Docker-based selenium grid launches a docker container per browser and terminates the container when browser session is finished. This approach addresses test isolation & infrastructure scalability problems.
Webpack,adopt,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://webpack.js.org/"">webpack</a> is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset."
CrossBrowserTesting.Com,trial,tools,FALSE,Provides WebDriver connectivity to dozen of browsers and real devices. Also it offers the possibility to manually take bulk screenshots of web pages.
ElasticSearch Percolator,trial,tools,FALSE,"Inverted search: For us this would help with saved search, where we store the searches in ES and use our listing events to match saved searches and notify the users on matches. Either in realtime or when the user wants to be notified. <a href=""https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-percolate-query.html"">Perculate Query (Perculator successor)</a>"
Jenkins 2.0,trial,tools,FALSE,"With the release of Jenkins 2.0 and the native support for pipelines and a successful PoC we believe that Jenkins can solve the issues we have with GoCD. To mention some:
* A separate CI/CD tool for each team
* Immutable build agents (Docker)
* Customizable build agents (Docker)
* Support for GitHub PRs
* Pipeline as code (Jenkinsfile)
* Dynamic agent scaling (""pay per build"")
* SAML support"
Prometheus-Style Monitoring,trial,tools,FALSE,"Though we don't plan to use Prometheus as a monitoring system, we see the advantage in using Prometheus-style metrics. SDKs already exist for various languages and the protocol seems to evolve as a de facto standard. Therefore, the integration in DataDog, our current monitoring system, and possible future solutions is straightforward."
Firebase,trial,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://firebase.google.com/"">Firebase</a> currently used to send push notifications to Android devices and gathering data about the user and his app usage. TODO [IF] Adjust text for adopt."
Cloud Custodian,trial,tools,FALSE,"Capital One released <a href=""https://developer.capitalone.com/opensource-projects/cloud-custodian"">Cloud Custodian</a> to the OSS world. It's a rule engine caring about most of the known housekeeping tasks in larger AWS setups."
Quixote,trial,tools,FALSE,"Quixote is a library for testing CSS. It's fast—over 100 tests/second—and has a powerful API. You can use it for unit testing (test your CSS files directly) or integration testing (test against a real server). Either way, your tests check how HTML elements are actually rendered by the browser."
Code Quality tools,trial,tools,TRUE,SonarQube + Codacy TODO [ZM]
Amazon Athena,assess,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/athena/"">AWS Athena</a> is a new AWS service which allows serverless interactive queries to data on S3. We would like to assess this technology as an additional way users can access the data available in our datalake."
Atomist,assess,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.atomist.com/"">Atomist</a> is a very young project geared towards developer productivity. Centered around ChatOps within Slack or CLI it aims to automate the whole development flow. Including smart, templated based repository creation and delivery pipelines."
Sauce Labs,assess,tools,FALSE,"Cloud-based platform for automated testing of web and mobile applications. Access web browsers, mobile emulators and simulators, and real mobile devices."
Datadog APM,assess,tools,FALSE,Datadog released a private beta version of its new APM tool. We feel the need for deeper insights into our applications and request flows. As it does not support the JVM yet we keep an eye on its future development.
Bluepill,assess,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://github.com/linkedin/bluepill"">Bluepill</a> is a reliable iOS testing tool that runs UI tests using multiple simulators on a single machine."
Amazon Redshift Spectrum,assess,tools,TRUE,"Amazon Redshift Spectrum allows users to directly query large amounts of data residing in Amazon S3 without having to run prior transformations over this data. As such, it is an ideal candidate for queries on the data that resides in our datalake."
H2O,hold,tools,TRUE,"H2O is an open source deep learning platform we have been using for some time. Now, because of a rewrite for one of our Microservices, we are switching to SciKit Learn (as the new language is Python)."
ECS/Infinity,adopt,platforms,FALSE,"When it comes to container orchestration it feels like a gold rush. At Scout24, we decided to use Amazon ECS as it provides a nice integration with IAM, is supported by CloudFormation and makes AutoScaling easy. Teams who don't want to manage their own cluster should look at Infinity, our managed ECS cluster."
Node.js for microservices,trial,platforms,TRUE,"We would like to introduce Node.js and JavaScript as an official alternative to JVM and Scala for microservices. Node.js is generally more appealing for frontend oriented developers. Performance of Node.js is at least on par with JVM for web relevant tasks, especially with a lot of blocking IO. The challenge is to integrate it into the AutoScout24 ecosystem."
Presto on Amazon EMR,trial,platforms,TRUE,Presto is a technology that allows to run interactive SQL queries over petabytes of data. The fact that it is available on EMR means that we can easily unlock the potential of this technology for our analysts and do so in a highly scalable manner.
Translation Service,assess,platforms,TRUE,TODO [ZM]
Apache Flink,assess,platforms,TRUE,"Flink is an event stream processing framework that has been successfully used to build the read side of event-sourced CQRS apps. With its modern take on managing state within the app, its checkpointing facilities and strong event processing primitives, it constitutes and interesting framework for building event-sourced CRQS systems."
ScalaTest,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,We choose ScalaTest as our primary Scala testing tool. It's easy to pick up and supports test styles that are familiar to most developers coming from other languages.
Python for Machine Learning,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We use <a href=""https://www.python.org/"">Python</a> in many cases for many Machine Learning use cases. Python provides a lot of scalable, state-of-the-art, free and open-source ressources for ML."
Apache Spark for Analytics,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://spark.apache.org/"">Apache Spark</a> is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It is replacing the traditional MapReduce paradigm. We use Apache Spark with Hive and SparkSQL as backend for Microstrategy and for most of our deep and explorative analyses."
ReactiveX,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://reactivex.io/"">ReactiveX</a> is a set of cross-language Reactive extensions that facilitate <a href=""https://cycle.js.org/streams.html"">reactive programming</a>. It's advantages over other language-specific reactive libraries is unified syntax/logic over all platforms (clients available in all major languages), so knowledge gained in RxJS can be reused in RxScala. It also provides common concepts that are easily understandable across codebases in comparison with custom-logic. Usage is highly encouraged when dealing with data/event streams, or complex async logic. "
Typescript,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.typescriptlang.org/"">TypeScript</a> provides a modern type system on top of Javascript, allowing for safer code, easier refactoring and great IDE experience compared to plain JS. It is arguably the standard for any ""complex"" project (i.e. AngularJS, RxJS, ImmutableJS). In the context of autoscout24 where developers already use strongly-typed languages such as Scala o C#, adoption is extremely encouraged since it should be easy to pick up and provides big benefits."
Python for automation,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,Python has been already the default language for automation at ImmoScout24 and Scout24. Therefore it makes sense to join our forces (OneScout) and use Python as default language for atuomation and scripting.
C#,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We are migrating to Linux, JVM and Scala, but our legacy code base is written in C#. As we need to maintain our existing stack during the migration, there is still C# work to be done."
Modern JavaScript,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,JavaScript is evolving faster now than it used to. Every year the standard is updated and new features are coming out. These features gain support in modern browsers quickly. With transpilers (e.g. Babel) we can provide fallback support for older browsers.
Kotlin,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href=""https://kotlinlang.org/"">Kotlin</a> is now officially supported by Android: Any new stuff should be written in Kotlin except you are not familiar with the language. We can use it also for writing APIs and services "
Python 3,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,Python 3 has been in existence for 8+ years now and Python 3 support is set to overtake Python 2 support. We should use Python 3 for all new projects implemented in Python. In the following page you can find the most used pypi packages readiness for python 3 support http://py3readiness.org. For more details please refer to the page https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3.
Linting,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors. It plays a big role for loosly typed languages. Some tools just format the code, some can fix simpler errors themselves.
* ESlint for JavaScript
* Sclafmt for Scala
* Swiftlint for Swift
* Lint for Android"
ScalaFMT,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Good automatic formatting tools free the programmer from trivial work, enforce consistent styling and make code reviews simpler since only actual changes are included. <a href=""http://scalameta.org/scalafmt/"" target=""_blank"">ScalaFMT</a> does a very good job at auto-formatting Scala code, therefore it is recommended to use it thoroughly and enable checks on the CI server so all committed code is properly formatted."
Kafka Streams,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.confluent.io/product/kafka-streams/"">Kafka Streams</a> is an open-source stream processing library from Confluent. It offers the right set of abstractions for many of our use cases, without introducing operational complexity itself. It is tightly integrated with Kafka and does not require external dependencies for stateful operations. Be aware that Kafka Streams still suffers from stability issues: observe the behaviour of your app under shadow traffic, chaos monkey, and rolling updates before going live, and fix any issues discovered."
Apache Avro and Schema Registry,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Use <a href=""https://avro.apache.org/"">Avro</a> as default serialisation for Kafka streams. The <a href=""http://docs.confluent.io/3.0.0/schema-registry/docs/"">Avro schema registry</a> takes care that everybody sticks to the schema and keeps it compatible."
GraphQL,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://graphql.org/"">GraphQL</a> is a data query language for APIs. It originates from Facebook and allows the client to specify what should be returned as response. For the first set of APIs we decided to work with a simpler ""one size fits all"" model."
React Native,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react-native/"">React Native</a> is a ""framework"" for building full/hybrid native mobile apps using JS and the React ecosystem. In the context of autoscout24 ""mobile-first"" approach and mobile/web team integration, it's looking very promising as an alternative to separate iOS/Android codebases, allowing teams to code independently in JS within the existing native apps and having unified logic/techniques for Web/iOS/Android. An upcoming POC will shed more light on the topic"
React/ Preact,trial,languages & frameworks,TRUE,For some usecases we see the need of a JavaScript framework. React and other React-like frameworks make it natural to devide compley frontend systems into small components. Our experience also shows that developers learn it relatively quickly. There are still challenges with testing. Preact is an almost API-compatible alternative to React tuned for client side performance (load and execution). It only gives up on support for exotic or extinct browsers.
Akka for microservices,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://akka.io/"">Akka</a> is an actor-based library for handling concurrency and implementing reactive microservices through a distributed message system. In combination with Akka Persistence / Lagom it can be the basis for event sourced microservices. After our first attempts at building microservices with Akka and not indirectly via Play, we are not convinced. Similarly, our experiences with Akka Streams were not as smooth as expected. The behaviour on failure caught several teams by surprise. We therefore advise to favour Rx and Kafka Streams over Akka Streams. Chose Akka Streams as deliberate decision acknowledging the odds."
Ruby for automation and scripting,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"While ruby is still the common language for automation at AutoScout24, we believe we should join our forces (OneScout) and have only Python as default language for automation and scripting. This does not mean to change all existing tools and scripts, but new services should have a good reason to not use Python."
