Pre-compute as much as you can,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"Many parts of our web site are read heavy, so in a lot of places it makes sense to pre-compute instead of reacting to a request. Examples would be change propagation for listings, static content and CQRS"
Game Day Exercises,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"We want to avoid the 'backup without recovery' or the 'untested disaster readiness plan'. We should excercise our disaster recovery strategy regularly and have game days with different kinds of disasters. It is expected that Game Day Excercises lead to many challanges and exposes missing automation and concepts.<a href=""http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2016/3/3/the-new-normal-minimize-risk-by-maximizing-change"">THE NEW NORMAL: Minimize risk by maximizing change</a>"
Feature Toggles 'the proper way',adopt,techniques,FALSE,"There couldn't be a better explanation: <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html"">Pete Hodgson on Martin Fowler's Bliki - Feature Toggles</a>. As we put more and more services into production in new teams, we need emphasize the proper way: The first task in every new story should be to create the release toggle and you are only done, when the toggle is removed."
Q.A. in Production,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"With the rise of Continuous Delivery, the QA role is shifting to include analyzing software product quality in production. This involves monitoring of the production systems, coming up with alert conditions to detect urgent errors, determining ongoing quality issues and figuring out what measurements you can use in the production environment to make this work. This does not mean that pre-production QA is not needed anymore."
Custom Elements,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/"">Custom Elements</a> is a capability for creating your own custom HTML elements. They can have their own scripted behavior and CSS styling. They are a part of web components, but can also be used by themselves."
External User Journey Monitoring,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"In addition to monitoring individual services, we need to make sure that typical journeys of our users on AutoScout24 are working and performant from the outside. For example the search funnel journey from home page to creating a lead or the journey to create a listing."
Circuit Breaker,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html>Circuit breaker</a> is a stability pattern for distributed systems. We use <a href=""https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix"">Hystrix</a> and <a href=""http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/circuitbreaker.html"">Akka Circuit Breaker</a>."
Platform engineering product Teams,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"With introduction of AWS, we reduced the dependency to our former operations teams. But this approach also constrained some teams who lack the skills to self-manage a full application and operations stack.  We tackled this challenge by creating platform engineering product teams. These teams operate an internal platform which enables delivery teams to self-service deploy and operate systems with reduced lead time and stack complexity. The emphasis here is on API-driven self-service and supporting tools, with delivery teams still responsible for supporting what they deploy onto the platform. We do not want to create a separate DevOps team, and we are aware that some tools will be replaced whenever AWS (or others) offers a valuable solution."
Consumer-Driven Contracts,trial,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html"">Consumer-Driven Contracts</a> are a pattern for evolving services. Each consumer provides a contract to the service provider. The service provider can use these contracts to check if a planned change will break a client."
Progressive Webapps,trial,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/"">Progressive web apps</a> are web apps that are aiming to provide a similar experience as native apps. Depending on the device and browser our web app should progressively enhance the experience for the user."
Performance Monitoring,trial,techniques,TRUE,Continuously monitoring and showing the most important client side performance metrics on team dashboards. The goal is that degradation in client side performance is treated in the same way as red builds or bugs in production.
Logging using STDOUT,trial,techniques,TRUE,"All running processes log to STDOUT and we use logshipping to export data. As this is industry standard (<a href=""https://12factor.net/"">twelve factor app</a>) we also switch to this approach. This also helps with our adoption of Docker on ECS."
CQRS/Event Sourcing,trial,techniques,FALSE,"Command Query Responsibility Segregatin and Event Sourcing are a very powerful pattern, but no silver bullet. Immutable events stored in an append only fashion together with a read optimized query part make a good fit for microservices and for many use cases at AutoScout24. A good introduction: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/microservices-event-sourcing-cqrs"">Building Microservices with Event Sourcing and CQRS</a>. A good explanation that puts some concepts into context: <a href=""https://www.confluent.io/blog/making-sense-of-stream-processing/"">Stream processing, Event sourcing, Reactive, CEP... and making sense of it all</a>."
Business KPI Monitoring,trial,techniques,FALSE,"In addition to a ""keep the lights on"" monitoring, we need to include a business minded approach to monitoring. Include relevant business KPIs on dashboards and alert on anomonlies in those metrics. Is everything green for our customers and our business?  "
Replicate DBTables to Kafka,assess,techniques,TRUE,"Use Oracles Undo Redo Log to do Logshipping to Kafka. First tool we try is <a href=""http://www.dbvisit.com/products/dbvisit_replicate_real_time_oracle_database_replication/"">DBVisit Replicate</a>"
Canary Releases,assess,techniques,FALSE,"The name for this technique originates from miners who would carry a canary in a cage down the coal mines. If toxic gases leaked into the mine, it would kill the canary before killing the miners. A canary release provides a similar form of early warning for potential problems before impacting your entire production infrastructure or user base. Compared to `Feature Toggles` or `BlueGreen Deployments` this is not a simple switch but more a slider. FeatureBee (Scala) as well as AutoCanary24 support Canary Releases. You can canary release toggled features with traffic distribution or you can canary deploy new service instances with traffic distribution or shadow traffic."
Decouple Build and Deploy Tool,assess,techniques,FALSE,"We are currently using GoCD for CI and CD. This is convenient, as we have one place to define and see the whole pipeline. On the other hand are we limiting us to an agent based delivery. We could use one tools for CI that creates verified artifacts and use another specialized tool for delivery. This differentiation makes even more sense, when we look into container scheduler. For example Netflix uses Jenkins for CI and Spinnaker for delivery: <a href=""http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/03/how-we-build-code-at-netflix.html"">How we build code at Netflix<a/>"
Content Security Policy,assess,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://content-security-policy.com/"">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a>  is a new HTTP response header, allowing to reduce XSS risks on modern browsers by declaring what dynamic resources are allowed to load via a HTTP Header."
Automated Architecture Diagram,assess,techniques,FALSE,"Documenting systems is hard. Manually created architecture diagrams are short-lived and seldomly updated. To increase the quality and currentness of our documentation we are looking into ways to automatically depict architecture diagrams. <a href=""http://gcdt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/20_kumo.html"">kumo</a> from the glomex-cloud-deployment-tools (gcdt) is an exmaple of a CloudFormation template visualization."
External Product Engineering,hold,techniques,TRUE,"When our internal product engineering appears to be too busy, it might be tempting to outsource urgent or important projects. In reality, many of those quickly delivered external projects are pulled into our product engineering. As unplanned work in different tech stacks, this slows engineering down."
Log everything,hold,techniques,TRUE,"Logging just everything that could be possibly be logged is wasteful, expensive and rarely useful. For example logging each and every request in Jigsaw and all ELBs on the way  is causing issues with the logging infrastructure regularly. It makes operation painful, events are lost and queries are really slow. If you just need metrics like latencies, response status codes then use metrics (CloudWatch or Dropwizard) and not logging."
IP-Restriction,hold,techniques,TRUE,"We often see IP restriction as a mechnism to prevent unauthorized access. But it sounds like a good idea only in the first place, as there is no real authentication and authorization. It also introduces a wrong dependency between our local office IT and production services in the cloud. Instead, a proper protocol (like OAuth) in combination with Auth0 should be used."
Data Pump 'diversity',hold,techniques,FALSE,"Our data pumps are an implementation of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture"">Change data capture (CDC)</a> pattern. All our data pumps read from the same Oracle database and pump to AWS, but we ended up with many different implementations."
CMS Boxes misuse,hold,techniques,FALSE,"CMS boxes are a common pattern for us. They provided a fast way to get different content on the web pages. As we are deploying more often today and have introduced UI composition to include content from different sources, we think that we should use CMS boxes for editorial content only. We should not use them for bringing advertisements or label texts on the pages."
Feature Branches,hold,techniques,FALSE,Feature branches isolate your work and defer continuous integration. The longer they exist the more it hurts to merge them back. Practices like Gitflow can support such a behaviour. When the only reason to start a new branch is the fear of continuous integration and therefore continuous deployment stop it.
Custom Basic Authentication,hold,techniques,FALSE,"While we are in our migration phase from the datacenter to the cloud not all platform services are available yet. To secure our APIs and administrative pages is hard without being able to use an identity service, therefore we have started to create workarounds by seting up custom basic authentication. We should strive to replace those solutions with proper OAuth2 implementations."
Microstrategy,adopt,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://www.microstrategy.com"">Microstrategy</a> is a Business Intelligence and Analytics software. We use it as our central tool to analyse our data and to create dashboards."
Docker Compose for local dev stacks,adopt,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://docs.docker.com/compose/"">Docker compose</a> allows for ""one-click"" local app environment setups, which are essential for fast developer productivity, especially for complex projects that depend on multiple services to run (i.e Kafka/Elasticsearch related services). All autoscout24 projects should be launchable just by calling `docker-compose up` without any other system dependencies."
Open API,adopt,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://www.openapis.org/"">Open API</a> is a popular API description format for REST-like APIs. We choose it as main tool to describe our service. There is a rich set of tools available that can use an Open API description for generating documentation, mock a server or doing CDCs. It's also possible to generate server and client code, but the usage of this feature is controversial."
Security Monkey,adopt,tools,FALSE,We are using Security Monkey for auditing our security relevant resources in AWS. It has proven to be a reliable and helpful tool and led to improved overall security.
Kafka,adopt,tools,FALSE,We chose Kafka for our internal data enrichment pipelines. The lack of the log compaction feature in AWS Kinesis led us to roll our own solution.
Chaos Monkey,adopt,tools,FALSE,Testing our systems for resiliency is important to us. Chaos Monkey randomly kills machines in our live environment and helps us finding and preventing shortcomings in our service setup.
git-secrets,adopt,tools,FALSE,"To prevent secrets leaking on GitHub we are scanning our repositories with git-secrets. Compared to gitrob this tool also scans the file contents and can work preemptively as a pre-commit hook. <a href=""https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets"">Git-secrets<a/>"
Travis CI for OSS,adopt,tools,FALSE,"TravisCI is one of these tools which supports configuration as code. It's widely adopted, especially in OSS. It can be used as SaaS or On-Prem. We use it for Open Source projects only."
WebPageTest.org,adopt,tools,FALSE,WebPageTest is used by our teams to evaluate the page performance in our pipelines.
Gulp.js,adopt,tools,FALSE,"gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something."
CloudHealth,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.cloudhealthtech.com/solutions/enterprise"">CloudHealth</a> is a service to optimize the cloud usage in many aspects including costs."
CrossBrowserTesting.Com,trial,tools,FALSE,Provides WebDriver connectivity to dozen of browsers and real devices. Also it offers the possibility to manually take bulk screenshots of web pages.
OAuth2 for inter-service communication,trial,tools,FALSE,"Securing APIs with OAuth2 is a common pattern in the industry, we should use it also for our services when they are communicating with each other over public networks."
ElasticSearch Percolator,trial,tools,FALSE,"Inverted search: For us this would help with saved search, where we store the searches in ES and use our listing events to match saved searches and notify the users on matches. Either in realtime or when the user wants to be notified. <a href=""https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-percolate-query.html"">Perculate Query (Perculator successor)</a>"
Jenkins 2.0,trial,tools,FALSE,"With the release of Jenkins 2.0 and the native support for pipelines and a successful PoC we believe that Jenkins can solve the issues we have with GoCD. To mention some:
* A separate CI/CD tool for each team
* Immutable build agents (Docker)
* Customizable build agents (Docker)
* Support for GitHub PRs
* Pipeline as code (Jenkinsfile)
* Dynamic agent scaling (""pay per build"")
* SAML support"
Atomist,trial,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.atomist.com/"">Atomist</a> is a very young project geared towards developer productivity. Centered around ChatOps within Slack or CLI it aims to automate the whole development flow. Including smart, templated based repository creation and delivery pipelines."
Kafka Streams,trial,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://www.confluent.io/product/kafka-streams/"">Kafka Streams</a> is an open-source stream processing library from Confluent. It offers the right set of abstractions for many of our use cases, without introducing operational complexity itself. It is tightly integrated with Kafka and does not require external dependencies for stateful operations."
Prometheus-Style Monitoring,trial,tools,TRUE,"Though we don't plan to use Prometheus as a monitoring system, we see the advantage in using Prometheus-style metrics. SDKs already exist for various languages and the protocol seems to evolve as a de facto standard. Therefore, the integration in DataDog, our current monitoring system, and possible future solutions is straightforward."
Datadog Automatization,trial,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://www.datadoghq.com/"">Datadog</a> is our central monitoring solution. We are evaluating code to bring datadog alarms and dashbaord to code. We would like to follow our ""automate everything"" principal."
Hystrix,trial,tools,TRUE,"Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable."
Firebase,trial,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://firebase.google.com/"">Firebase</a> currently used to send push notifications to Android devices and gathering data about the user and his app usage"
Crucible,trial,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://de.atlassian.com/software/crucible"">Crucible</a> is a code review tool by Atlassian. We encourage doing more post-commit code reviews in order to spark discussions about the code, improve code quality, teach and share knowledge. "
Docker-based Selenium Grid,trial,tools,FALSE,Docker-based selenium grid launches a docker container per browser and terminates the container when browser session is finished. This approach addresses test isolation & infrastructure scalability problems.
Sauce Labs,assess,tools,FALSE,"Cloud-based platform for automated testing of web and mobile applications. Access web browsers, mobile emulators and simulators, and real mobile devices."
Cloud Custodian,assess,tools,FALSE,"Capital One released <a href=""https://developer.capitalone.com/opensource-projects/cloud-custodian"">Cloud Custodian</a> to the OSS world. It's a rule engine caring about most of the known housekeeping tasks in larger AWS setups."
Datadog APM,assess,tools,FALSE,Datadog released a private beta version of its new APM tool. We feel the need for deeper insights into our applications and request flows. As it does not support the JVM yet we keep an eye on its future development.
Quixote,assess,tools,TRUE,"Quixote is a library for testing CSS. It's fast—over 100 tests/second—and has a powerful API. You can use it for unit testing (test your CSS files directly) or integration testing (test against a real server). Either way, your tests check how HTML elements are actually rendered by the browser."
Fastlane,assess,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://fastlane.tools/"">fastlane</a> is the tool to release your iOS and Android app It handles all tedious tasks, like generating screenshots, dealing with code signing, and releasing your apps"
Bluepill,assess,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://github.com/linkedin/bluepill"">Bluepill</a> is a reliable iOS testing tool that runs UI tests using multiple simulators on a single machine."
Pivio.io,assess,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""http://pivio.io/"">Pivio.io</a> is an open-source service registry for humans. It is a small project driven by similar ideas as our metadata driven repository registry. This could be a direction we could evolve our approach to. "
Go CD,hold,tools,FALSE,"Even while GoCD is featured on the ThoughtWorks radar we still see a lot of effort in adding new pipelines. Also missing OAuth support, the missing support of configuration as code and fact that it doesn't scale dynamically are reasons to look for a tool that could handle these issues better."
HTTP/2,adopt,platforms,FALSE,"<a href=""https://http2.github.io/"">HTTP/2</a> is the next revision of HTTP. Improves user perceived latency. Current estimations say that 50% of our users could connect via HTTP/2."
AuthO,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"For us it's important to authenticate users of internal systems against our active directory. Also, 2FA authentication becomes mandatory. Auth0 makes it easy to integrate with, supports all needed protocols and provides custom rules to enrich the authentication flow."
AWS Athena,trial,platforms,TRUE,"<a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/athena/"">AWS Athena</a> is a new AWS service which allows serverless interactive queries to data on S3. We expect that Athena will solve many log analyses issues and data-driven insights without complex Hadoop setups. "
ECS/Infinity,trial,platforms,TRUE,"When it comes to containern orchestration it feels like a gold rush. At Scout24, we decided to use Amazon ECS as it provides a nice integration with IAM, is supported by CloudFormation and makes AutoScaling easy. Teams who don't want to manage their own cluster should look at Infinity, our managed ECS cluster."
Elastic.io,hold,platforms,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.elastic.io/"">Elastic.io</a> is a PaaS for ElasticSearch. We evaluated different approaches getting ES as a cloud platform service. Due to costs and secure connection strategies we are still working on a general solution."
Codahale Metrics,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://metrics.dropwizard.io/"">Dropwizard Metrics</a> (aka Codahale Metrics) allows to easily create custom application-level metrics and export them with JMX to DataDog"
Akka,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://akka.io/"">Akka</a> (and related <a href=""http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.0/scala/stream/index.html"">akka-streams</a>) is an actor-based library for handling concurrency and implementing reactive programming through a distributed message system. In combination with Akka Persistance / Lagom it can be the basis for event sourced services. ReactiveX also provides a means for reactive programming that has benefits over Akka (proper types, non-Scala clients) so use Akka where it makes sense."
ScalaTest,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We choose <a href=""http://www.scalatest.org/"">ScalaTest</a> as our primary Scala testing tool. It's easy to pick up and supports test styles that are familiar to most developers coming from other languages."
Swift,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, OS X, tvOS, and watchOS"
espresso test,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,Android UI tests
XcuiTest,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,iOS UI tests
Python for Machine Learning,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"We use <a href=""https://www.python.org/"">Python</a> in many cases for many Machine Learning use cases. Python provides a lot of scalable, state-of-the-art, free and open-source ressources for ML."
Apache Spark for Analytics,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href=""http://spark.apache.org/"">Apache Spark</a> is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It is replacing the traditional MapReduce paradigm. We use Apache Spark with Hive and SparkSQL as backend for Microstrategy and for most of our deep and explorative analyses."
ReactiveX,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://reactivex.io/"">ReactiveX</a> is a set of cross-language Reactive extensions that facilitate <a href=""https://cycle.js.org/streams.html"">reactive programming</a>. It's advantages over other language-specific reactive libraries is unified syntax/logic over all platforms (clients available in all major languages), so knowledge gained in RxJS can be reused in RxScala. It also provides common concepts that are easily understandable across codebases in comparison with custom-logic. Usage is highly encouraged when dealing with data/event streams, or complex async logic. "
Python for automation,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,Python has been already the default language for automation at ImmoScout24 and Scout24. Therefore it makes sense to join our forces (OneScout) and use Python as default language for atuomation and scripting.
Akka Persistence,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/persistence.html"">Akka Persistence</a> enables stateful Akka actors, that are backed by an event sourced journal storage. Different storage plugins are available."
Redux,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Ported from the <a href=""http://elm-lang.org/"">elm</a> language, <a href="""">Redux</a> is the standard for state-managment in the JS world. It allows for very clear top-down one-way data flow, state tracking, and isolated side-effects, together with amazing developer tools (i.e <a herf=""https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remote-redux-devtools"">remote devtools</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs"">Time travel</a>, <a href=""https://logrocket.com/"">Bug reporting</a>). Use is highly encouraged in any JS SPA, specially in combination with React."
Apache Avro and Schema Registry,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Use <a href=""https://avro.apache.org/"">Avro</a> as default serialisation for Kafka streams. The <a href=""http://docs.confluent.io/3.0.0/schema-registry/docs/"">Avro schema registry</a> takes care that everybody sticks to the schema and keeps it compatible."
Typescript,trial,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href=""https://www.typescriptlang.org/"">TypeScript</a> provides a modern type system on top of Javascript, allowing for safer code, easier refactoring and great IDE experience compared to plain JS. It is arguably the standard for any ""complex"" project (i.e. AngularJS, RxJS, ImmutableJS). In the context of autoscout24 where developers already use strongly-typed languages such as Scala o C#, adoption is extremely encouraged since it should be easy to pick up and provides big benefits."
GO Lang for Microservices,assess,languages & frameworks,FALSE,In the world of containers and microservices more and more companies are using Go to build their services. It's leightweight footprint and the absence of JIT-compilation make it an ideal candidate for use in a container. On the other hand it might lack some features and tools needed for web development. We should keep an eye on the development in the community.
Lagom,assess,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Reactive, eventsourced and CQRS based microservices on the Lightbend stack. Could be an extension of our Lightbend Play stack for microservices that are writing. See also Akka and Akka Persistence, which is part of <a href=""https://www.lightbend.com/lagom"">Lagom</a>"
GraphQL,assess,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://graphql.org/"">GraphQL</a> is a data query language for APIs. It originates from Facebook and allows the client to specify what should be returned as response. For the first set of APIs we decided to work with a simpler ""one size fits all"" model."
React Native,assess,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react-native/"">React Native</a> is a ""framework"" for building full/hybrid native mobile apps using JS and the React ecosystem. In the context of autoscout24 ""mobile-first"" approach and mobile/web team integration, it's looking very promising as an alternative to separate iOS/Android codebases, allowing teams to code independently in JS within the existing native apps and having unified logic/techniques for Web/iOS/Android. An upcoming POC will shed more light on the topic"
C#,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,AutoScout's move to the Linux OS is contradictory to continue using C#. Even with Mono being available we believe that the JVM is a better choice due to it's broader adoption on Linux
Ruby for automation and scripting,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"While ruby is still the common language for automation at AutoScout24, we believe we should join our forces (OneScout) and have only Python as default language for automation and scripting. This does not mean to change all existing tools and scripts, but new services should have a good reason to not use Python."
Objective C,hold,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Objective-C is the old language to create iPhone, iPad, and Mac apps"
Pact CDC,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Define a <a href=""https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact"">pact</a> between service consumers and providers, enabling 'consumer driven contract' testing. During our trial we learned that Pact CDC is cumbersome without also introducing Pact Broker."
